## üîå Integration

### Claude Desktop

Add the server config to your Claude Desktop configuration:

**MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serper-search-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/serper-search-server/build/index.js",
      "env": {
        "SERPER_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ† Usage

### Search Tool

The server provides a powerful search tool with the following parameters:

```typescript
{
  "query": string,          // Search query
  "numResults"?: number,    // Number of results (default: 10, max: 100)
  "gl"?: string,           // Country code (e.g., "us", "uk")
  "hl"?: string,           // Language code (e.g., "en", "es")
  "autocorrect"?: boolean, // Enable autocorrect (default: true)
  "type"?: "search"        // Search type (more types coming soon)
}
```

### Deep Research Tool

For more comprehensive research needs, the server provides a deep research tool that performs multi-step research with the following parameters:

```typescript
{
  "query": string,          // Research query or question
  "depth"?: "basic" | "standard" | "deep",  // Research depth (default: "standard")
  "maxSources"?: number     // Maximum sources to include (default: 10)
}
```

The deep research tool:
- Breaks down complex queries into focused sub-queries
- Executes multiple searches to gather comprehensive information
- Uses AI to synthesize information from multiple sources
- Formats results with proper citations and references
- Adapts its research strategy based on intermediate results
- Collects anonymous quality metrics to improve search results

Depth Levels:
- basic: Quick overview (3-5 sources, ~5 min)
  Good for: Simple facts, quick definitions, straightforward questions
- standard: Comprehensive analysis (5-10 sources, ~10 min)
  Good for: Most research needs, balanced depth and speed
- deep: Exhaustive research (10+ sources, ~15-20 min)
  Good for: Complex topics, academic research, thorough analysis
