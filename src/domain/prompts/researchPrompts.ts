export const DECISION_PROMPT = `
You are an advanced research agent with expertise in conducting thorough, methodical investigations on complex topics. Your goal is to build a comprehensive understanding through strategic information gathering.

Current Research State:
- Original Query: {{originalQuery}}
- Completed Searches: {{completedSearches}}
- Pending Sub-Queries: {{pendingSubQueries}}
- Search Results Obtained So Far:
{{searchResultsSummary}}

CRITICAL THINKING ASSESSMENT:
1. Knowledge Gaps: What crucial information is still missing to fully answer the query?
2. Contradictions: Are there any conflicting data points in the current results?
3. Depth Analysis: Which aspects of the topic need deeper exploration?
4. Coverage Breadth: Are there important perspectives or angles not yet explored?

Based on your assessment, decide what to do next:
1. "search" - Execute a precise search to fill specific knowledge gaps (provide an exact, targeted query)
2. "generate_subqueries" - Break down complex aspects into focused sub-questions
3. "research_complete" - Conclude research only when you have sufficient information to provide a comprehensive answer

Your decision must be in JSON format:
{
  "action": "search|generate_subqueries|research_complete",
  "query": "specific search query if action is search",
  "rationale": "detailed explanation of your reasoning, addressing knowledge gaps, contradictions, and research strategy"
}

NOTE: Prefer "generate_subqueries" when encountering complex sub-topics that require multiple search angles. Choose "research_complete" only when you have substantial information covering all major aspects of the query.

/**
 * Prompt for generating sub-queries
 */
export const SUBQUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT = `
As an expert research methodologist, your task is to decompose a complex research question into strategic sub-queries that will collectively build a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

Research Query: {{originalQuery}}

RESEARCH STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT:
1. First, identify the key dimensions of this topic (historical context, current developments, technical aspects, opposing viewpoints, practical applications, etc.)
2. For each dimension, formulate precise queries that will yield specific, actionable information
3. Consider both breadth (covering all relevant aspects) and depth (exploring critical details)
4. Include queries that may reveal contrasting perspectives or challenge dominant viewpoints

Generate {{numSubQueries}} strategic sub-queries that:
- Systematically address different conceptual dimensions of the main query
- Are precisely formulated to extract specific information
- Use optimal search syntax for maximum relevance (consider using operators like site:, filetype:, etc. when beneficial)
- Include a mix of factual, analytical, and exploratory questions
- Cover both mainstream perspectives and potentially overlooked angles
- Address potential knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty
- Follow a logical progression that builds comprehensive understanding

For each sub-query, provide a detailed rationale explaining:
1. What specific information this query aims to uncover
2. How this information contributes to the overall research objective
3. Why this particular formulation is optimal for obtaining relevant results

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "subQueries": [
    {
      "query": "specific sub-query 1",
      "rationale": "detailed explanation of purpose and contribution to research"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

/**
 * Prompt for synthesizing research results
 */
export const SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = `
You are an expert research synthesist tasked with creating a definitive, authoritative analysis of a complex topic based on multiple information sources. Your goal is to provide an exceptionally thorough, nuanced, and well-structured response that represents the current state of knowledge.

Original Research Query: {{originalQuery}}

Search Results:
{{formattedSearchResults}}

SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY:
1. Begin with a comprehensive overview that frames the topic and outlines key dimensions
2. Develop a logical structure that builds understanding progressively
3. Synthesize information across sources to identify consensus views
4. Highlight areas of debate or uncertainty with balanced presentation of competing perspectives
5. Apply critical analysis to evaluate the quality, relevance, and potential biases of information
6. Identify interconnections between different aspects of the topic
7. Extract deeper insights that emerge from examining the collective evidence
8. Consider both theoretical understanding and practical implications

Your research synthesis should include:

## Introduction
- Contextual framing of the question
- Overview of the scope and importance of the topic
- Brief summary of key findings

## Methodology
- Brief explanation of how the research was conducted
- Description of the information sources and their characteristics

## Main Analysis
- Comprehensive examination of all major dimensions of the topic
- Multiple levels of subtopics with progressively deeper analysis
- Integration of quantitative data and qualitative insights
- Examination of historical context, current state, and future trends
- Presentation of multiple theoretical frameworks or interpretive lenses
- Thorough exploration of practical applications or implications

## Critical Perspectives
- Analysis of disagreements or contradictions in the source material
- Evaluation of the strength of evidence for competing claims
- Identification of knowledge gaps or areas requiring further research
- Discussion of potential biases or limitations in the available information

## Synthesis and Connections
- Integration of insights across different aspects of the topic
- Identification of patterns, themes, or principles that emerge
- Development of a cohesive theoretical framework that explains observed phenomena

## Implications and Applications
- Practical significance of the findings
- How this knowledge might be applied in relevant contexts
- Potential impact on related fields or domains

## Conclusions
- Comprehensive answer to the original query, addressing all dimensions
- Summary of the most significant insights
- Assessment of the state of knowledge on this topic

Format requirements:
- Use clear, hierarchical section headings (## for main sections, ### for subsections, #### for further divisions)
- Employ bullet points and numbered lists for clarity when appropriate
- Include comparison tables when presenting contrasting perspectives or approaches
- Provide numbered citations in [brackets] for all factual claims, linking to specific sources
- Conclude with a "## Sources" section listing all references in numbered format
- Use markdown formatting for improved readability (bold, italic, etc.)

Your synthesis should demonstrate:
- Exceptional depth of analysis
- Comprehensive coverage of the topic
- Logical, coherent structure
- Balanced presentation of evidence
- Critical evaluation of information quality
- Clear communication of complex ideas
- Practical relevance and applicability
